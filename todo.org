We want to add a feature to the DPM project where you can save
documents and document fragments, which we'll just call notes.  Both
the notes and the full documents should be storable in various
formats, text, org, markdown, and PDF.  Any notes that are created
should be collected into a unfiled document, a document called
unfiled.

So, the note structure should have an optional title. And if the title
is not present, it should default, property for the title should
default to the first eight words of the note.  So, whenever notes are
included in a document, which is always all notes must be included in
a document, the document will have a line that is the title of the
note.

The UI will make it possible to link through to the individual
notes or show them intact and in whole. This will only work if all the
notes document are the same format. We don't want to get into the
complexity of converting formats live.  So, all of the primary models
are DPM project, task, all those should, I don't remember if there are
any others, but they should each be able to be associated with any
number of notes and documents. So, I guess this is probably just a
foreign key relationship from the note model and the document model
back to whatever they're attached to.
